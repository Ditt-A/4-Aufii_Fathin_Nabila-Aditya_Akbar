As I love to travel myself I know how important it is to have a great place where you can enjoy some peace and rest after a busy day discovering the city! \\nAlso very important; to stay in an apartment that will amaze you and be even better than promised instead of a big disappointment that is not really similar to the pictures and not that central as you wished...\\n\\nAs I'm in between jobs and going to move in with my boyfriend I decided to make myself useful and rent out my beautiful house to visitors of Amsterdam and be a part of a great travel experience!\\n\\nSo I'm going to make sure that you will have a wonderful time in my apartment and hopeful I can help you to enjoy our amazing Amsterdam!   \n",
       "1  I live together with my girlfriend in our apartment in Amsterdam. We enjoy every moment in it and in the city of Amsterdam\\n\\nI have my own company in telecom and we both enjoy traveling, exploring new places and sport. We are still quiet young (36 & 29) and really enjoy all the different sides of Amsterdam - it a beautiful and peaceful city with a great shopping, restaurant and nightlife scene! \\n\\nWe want to let people enjoy and love Amsterdam as much as we do while they're staying here. Amsterdam is a unique city and the best way to enjoy it is by staying in a typical and authentic house in the centre with everything you want to see on walking distance! \\n\\nOur house is very comfortable for 4 people as it has two bedrooms. You can enjoy the sun on the 2 balconies the whole day...   \n",
